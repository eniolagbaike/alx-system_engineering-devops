1 load-balancer (HAproxy); is a network solution to help distribute traffic across your servers. It provides high availability at the network (TCP) and application (HTTP/S) layers and increases speed and performance.

The Load balancer uses the Round Robin Algorithm which distributes HTTP requests sequentially across all server and repeats the loop from top to bottom.

Round Robin Algorithm enables the Active-Active Setup, which essentialy means both servers are running and accepting HTTP requests sequentially to avoid overload of one node. 
Whereas, in an Active- Passive Setup, only one node ia active while the other acts as a backup or standby incase of SPOF.

In a Primary-Replica(Master-Slave) cluster; The master does the writing while the slave database base acts as the backup. All requests first go throught the master, then sends reading operations across multiple slaves.

The Primary node accepts requests, while the Replica node is a slave to the primary node and fetches results bases on Primary Node request.

PROBLEMS  WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE;
SPOF; When there is an overload of requests, the nodes maynot process requests fast enough in other to accept new ones, this can result in SPOF of the Load Balancer.

NO HTTPS, NO FIREWALLS; There is no encryption in connection so therefore your network can be easily compromised.

NO MONITORING; As the popular saying goes you cannot improve what you cannot measure. When there is no monitoring, it is hard to predict problems from SPOF or slow loading webpages
